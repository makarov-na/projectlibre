#The strings must be kept sorted by key so as to facilitate assuring correspondence between different languages.

#Some strings contain templates: Baseline# Cost becomes Baseline1 Cost, Baseline2 Cost, etc.
#The # gets replaced by a number for each one
#Another type of templating is used sometimes in messages where values within  {} are replaced with text - a task name for example
#Anything within the {} symbols must not be translated

# The strings whose keys have the .mf suffix must be formated with the rules described in
# http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html
# For extense the quotes ' must be doubled and replaced by '' .

# The \n in some messages is used to force a new line. It is used to break up long messages into several lines.
# Strings which start with one or more "\ " should retain those "\ " as they are used to represent single spaces
# Some strings contain spaces at the end. Be careful to conserve them
# Strings with colons at the end should retain the colons at the end
